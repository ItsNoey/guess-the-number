Guess the Number game

Hello. This game is the first project I got to work on while learning JavaScript with Jonas Schmedtman's Udemy The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!

In this project I got to learn about the DOM manipulation, Event Listener and refactoring the code. It was fun while challenging for me trying to understand the logic.
You can guess the number from 1 - 20 and the score will keep decreasing if your guess is wrong. Once you win, you can hit the 'Again' button to reset the game, but the 'highscore' will stay unless you beat the current highscore, then it will update the score.

I will revisit the project and try to rewrite the code on my own to solidify my knowledge.

Thanks for visiting! :D
